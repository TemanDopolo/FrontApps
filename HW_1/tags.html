        <p>Top bugs in Java Projects in 2020</p>
        In <time datetime="2020">previous year</time> we (the PVS-Studio's Java team) have reviewed errors from couple of open-source projects.

        <h1>Bug 1</h1>
        <p>Tricky equality</p>
        <h2>Issue description:</h2>
        Here's an example of a simple and very disappointing mistake which occurred due to <strong>inattention</strong>:
        the <code>processedData</code> field is compared to itself. Because of this mistake, comparison of the
        <code>CheckpointStatistics</code>
        type objects will sometimes give a false positive result. But the main danger of this typo lies in the fact
        that <strong>equals is very actively used in collections</strong>, and incorrect implementation of this method
        can lead to very strange behavior, which will take a huge amount of time to debug. For the record, it is common 
        for developers to make mistakes in comparison functions. My colleague even wrote a whole article <mark>"The Evil within 
        the Comparison Functions"</mark> with lots of examples and explanations.
        <h3>Code example:</h3>
        <code>
            @Override
            public boolean equals(Object o) {
                ....
                CheckpointStatistics that = (CheckpointStatistics) o;
                return id == that.id &&
                savepoint == that.savepoint &&
                triggerTimestamp == that.triggerTimestamp &&
                latestAckTimestamp == that.latestAckTimestamp &&
                stateSize == that.stateSize &&
                duration == that.duration &&
                alignmentBuffered == that.alignmentBuffered &&
                processedData == processedData &&                // &lt;=
                persistedData == that.persistedData &&
                numSubtasks == that.numSubtasks &&
                numAckSubtasks == that.numAckSubtasks &&
                status == that.status &&
                Objects.equals(checkpointType, that.checkpointType) &&
                Objects.equals(
                checkpointStatisticsPerTask, 
                that.checkpointStatisticsPerTask);
            }

        <h1>Bug 2</h1>
        <p>Unreachable code</p>
        <h2>Issue description:</h2>
        The switch branch for the value <code>i == 0x0822(2082)</code> happens to be unreachable. How on earth did that happen? If you pay 
        attention to the <code>1 &lt;&lt; height</code> loop condition where height is always equal to 10, then everything immediately falls into 
        place. According to the loop condition, the counter <em>i</em> in the <em>for</em> loop can't be greater than <em>1024 (1 &lt;&lt; 10)</em>. Obviously,
        the execution of the switch branch in question will never happen.
        <h3>Code example:</h3>
        <code>
            public void testSignSHA256CompleteEvenHeight2() {
                ....
                int height = 10;
                ....
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; height); i++) {
                    byte[] signature = xmss.sign(new byte[1024]);
                    switch (i) {
                        case 0x005b:
                            assertEquals(signatures[0], Hex.toHexString(signature));
                            break;
                        case 0x0822:
                            assertEquals(signatures[1], Hex.toHexString(signature));
                            break;
                        ....
                    }
                }
            }
        </code>

        <h1>Bug 3</h1>
        <p>A time bomb</p>
        <h2>Issue description:</h2>
        The above code snippet is certainly messed up. If you follow <code>selectedNode</code> from <code>processSelection()</code>, when <code>selectedNode == null</code>, you will 
        immediately find that with this outcome, <abbr title="NullPointerException">NPE</abbr> inevitably awaits us. This is exactly what the analyzer warns us about. 
        But after studying the code a little, the author of the article concluded that the program execution will never meet <abbr title="NullPointerException">NPE</abbr>, 
        since the <code>processSelection()</code> method is called in only two places, before calling which, selectedNode is  <span style="color: red;">explicitly checked for the null</span>.
        Despite this, such code is a time bomb, because another developer may notice that the method explicitly handles the case of <code>selectedNode == null</code>, 
        and decide that this is a valid value, which will then result in the application crash.
        <h3>Code example:</h3>
        <code>
            private void processSelection(OptionsTreeNode selectedNode) {
                if (selectedNode == null) {
                setViewPanel(defaultPanel, selectedNode); // &lt;=
                return;
                }
                ....
            }
            private void setViewPanel(JComponent component, OptionsTreeNode selectedNode) {
                ....
                setHelpLocation(component, selectedNode);
                ....
            }
            private void setHelpLocation(JComponent component, OptionsTreeNode node) {
                Options options = node.getOptions();
                ....
            }
        </code>
